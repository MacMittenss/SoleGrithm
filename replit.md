## System Architecture

The application employs a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **UI Framework**: Custom component library built on Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system (New York style variant), supporting dark/light themes.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop, interactive hover previews for sneaker cards, visual adaptation for dynamic content rotation (e.g., "AI Picks of the Day"), professional market data cards, and advanced AR controls.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for chat, recommendations, content generation, image analysis, and user profiling with smart fallback systems for quota management.
- **Data Strategy Services**: Modular architecture for user tracking, Firebase profiles, third-party sync, and AI personalization.
- **Anonymous Analytics**: Session-based tracking system.
- **Market Data Integration**: Live price feeds and market analysis.

### Core Features & Design Patterns
- **Authentication**: Firebase handles user registration, login, and token management, with automatic local database creation for new users.
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) for type-safe operations and schema migrations.
- **AI-Powered Features**: SoleBot (chat assistant), AI-generated content and collections with intelligent fallbacks, sneaker image recognition and analysis (OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API), price prediction, personalized recommendations, AI user profiling, anonymous interaction analysis, and real-time personalization.
- **Data Flow**: Frontend uses Firebase tokens for authenticated requests; backend verifies tokens; Drizzle ORM handles database operations. AI API calls are managed via a dedicated service layer with robust fallback systems.
- **Data Storage Strategy**: User profiles, sneaker catalog, collections, reviews, and price history are stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Interactive Map**: A geographic map visualizes sneaker trends across major US cities with heat map visualization and city-specific insights, integrated into the navigation.
- **Unified Live Market**: Catalog and Live Market sections are merged into a single "Live Market" experience with real-time price indicators and market analytics.
- **Enhanced Detail Pages**: Live market data display, AR Try-On functionality, and direct purchase links integrated into SneakerDetail pages.
